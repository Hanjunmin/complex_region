# Human genome complexity and its biomedical insights from the pangenome graph

A repo for orignal code and methods related to analyses and figures generation for the complex region study

Four sections are included:
1.	Complex region decomposition: compelxity index generation and genome region classfication with eight complexity indices
2.	Association between diseases and complex Regions: premature test and 106 genomic disoder asscation 
3.	haplotype decomposition within complex regions: 22q11.2 and 2q13
4.	Pan-SD and Pan-VNTR study methods: metholgoies bulding and population-stratification analysis
